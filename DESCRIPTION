Description: Provides functions for generating correlated time-to-event and binary 
    outcomes in clinical trial simulations. Supports multiple treatment arms, 
    subgroups, and event-driven analyses with proper correlation structure modeling 
    using copulas. Includes validation of Frechet-Hoeffding bounds and comprehensive 
    statistical testing capabilities for overall survival, progression-free survival,
    and objective response endpoints.
