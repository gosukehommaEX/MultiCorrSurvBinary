\title{Perform Statistical Test for Single Outcome and Comparison}
\usage{
TestsSurvBinary(data, outcome, treatment_arm, control_arm, alternative)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Comparison dataset (two arms only)}

\item{outcome}{Outcome name ("OS", "PFS", or "OR")}

\item{treatment_arm}{Treatment arm name}

\item{control_arm}{Control arm name}

\item{alternative}{Alternative hypothesis direction ("greater", "less", "two.sided")}
}
\value{
List with test results including sample sizes, events, and p-value
}
\description{
This function performs appropriate statistical tests for different outcome types
including time-to-event outcomes (OS, PFS) using log-rank tests and binary
outcomes (OR) using chi-squared tests with pooled proportion.
}
\details{
For time-to-event outcomes (OS, PFS):
- Uses survdiff() from survival package for log-rank test
- Calculates one-sided p-values by comparing observed vs expected events
- "greater" alternative tests if treatment arm has better survival (fewer events)

For binary outcomes (OR):
- Uses pooled proportion chi-squared test
- Calculates z-statistic with pooled standard error
- "greater" alternative tests if treatment arm has higher response rate
}
